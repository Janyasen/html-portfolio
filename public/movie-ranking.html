<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Grave of the Fireflies</h3>
<p>This is a beautifully done anime. The artwork is gorgeous. The story is very sad, and I wish world leaders and people in general would see this movie and decide that humanity really needs to do better, and treat each other in a more humane manor.</p>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>This 2021 version of Dune is the first film version of this story that portrayed it exactly as I imagined it while reading the book.</p>
<h3>The Witch</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed how well this film depicts how religion is the cause for so much oppression, misogyny and fear.</p>
